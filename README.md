slowImg
=======

Script to serve image file slowly.  Just install on your PHP-enabled system and invoke with `http://<yourServer>/slowImg.php?name=fileName&time=timeInMillis`

The file `fileName` should be in the same directory as this script, or you can just use the red/green ball images already included.

I needed this while trying to tweak the "loading" page for a game.  It was handy to have a very long load even on a local system so I could debug the loading routine.
